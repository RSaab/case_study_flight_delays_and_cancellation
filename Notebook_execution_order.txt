The notebooks should be ran in the following order in order to manipulate the initial dataset into the one we are using for the analysis. The first notebook takes as input the 2008 raw data. The dataset can be downloaded from http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html. We could not include it in the submission since is very big. Regression.ipynb and Classification_Final.ipynb use the same file, cleaned2.1.csv, produced by preprocessing_Final.ipynb.
