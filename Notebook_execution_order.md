The notebooks should be executed in the following order to convert the initial dataset to the one used for the analysis.   
The first notebook takes as input the 2008 raw data. The dataset can be downloaded from [DataExpo2009](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) (It couldn't be included in the submission due to its size).   
Regression.ipynb and Classification_Final.ipynb use the same file, cleaned2.1.csv, produced by preprocessing_Final.ipynb.  

#### Order:
1. preprocess_flights_data.ipynb
2. preprocess_weather_data.ipynb
3. merging_weather_data.ipynb
4. preprocessing_Final.ipnb
5. Regression.ipynb
6. Classification_Final.ipynb
